# individual_fns contains:

# code to generate MS-HBM derived individual parcellations for both the 19 test retest DBIS participants and the full
# 762 participants (mix of shell and matlab code)

# R scripts to generate descriptive summaries of MS-HBM parcellation and behavior data

# R scripts to conduct coarse behavior analyses between MS-HBM network surface area and gait, IQ, and auditory discrimination

# initial shell/matlab scripts for generating NMF parcellations (only got partway through this and focused on MS-HBM)
